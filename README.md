# Fake credit card generator

I am replicating the same project I created using Python many many years aog. Project [fake-credit-card](https://github.com/bhuone-garbu/fake-credit-card) 

I wanted to create a JavaScript version of it so that I can run on the browser. It was also an opportunity for me to refresh my mind on:

* React and hooks
* Styled-components
